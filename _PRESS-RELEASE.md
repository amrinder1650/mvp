There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Random Team Generator

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  This product is for athletes who spend hours picking teams.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Random Team Generator is a product that picks random pairs. All the customer/reader/user has to do is type in the names of all the athletes/participants and the generator will pick random teams of pairs.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  This solves all the problems of having to pick a team: time, energy, and hurt feelings. With a randomization factor, there are no excuses and this allows teams to be relitively balanced.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Have you ever been at park and one of your best friends has been the captain? BUT THEY DO NOT PICK YOU! Or another example is, have you been at the park. And it takes forever to pick teams. And by the time the teams are picked, the sun is already setting so you only have 15 minutes left to play.
  Random Team Generator fixes all of those issues. All the user has to do is add all the names to the database, hit "Generate Teams" and random teams will be generated.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Stop wasting your time and energy. We will pick the teams for you. All you have to worry about is serving that ace, making that basket, or scoring that touchdown."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  All the user has to do is add all the names to the database, hit "Generate Teams" and random teams will be generated.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "My friends and I used to waste hours trying to decide what the teams were going to be and how to balance them so they are fair. With Random Team Generator, the algorithm handles all those issues for us. We just show up, hit "Generate" and perfect our skills."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Next, readers/users should try out our random bracket maker!
